## Introduction

The ITR dimension recognizes that successful quantum-resistant migration requires more than just selecting appropriate algorithmsâ€”it demands comprehensive technical planning, systematic integration approaches, and robust operational capabilities. Organizations must assess their current technology landscape, plan for seamless integration of quantum-resistant solutions, and establish processes for ongoing maintenance and optimization.

This dimension is particularly critical as it bridges the gap between theoretical quantum-resistant knowledge and practical implementation. It addresses the technical challenges organizations face when transitioning from classical to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems while maintaining operational continuity and security effectiveness.
