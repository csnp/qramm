# QRAMM Dimensions Summary

## Understanding the Four Dimensions

The Quantum Readiness Assurance Maturity Model (QRAMM) is built on four integrated dimensions that comprehensively address all aspects of quantum readiness. Each dimension targets specific organizational capabilities essential for successful quantum-safe transformation.

## Quick Reference

| Dimension | Focus Area | Key Outcome |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **CVI** | Cryptographic Visibility & Inventory | Complete understanding of cryptographic landscape and quantum vulnerabilities |
| **SGRM** | Strategic Governance & Risk Management | Executive leadership and organizational commitment to quantum readiness |
| **DPE** | Data Protection Engineering | Technical implementation of quantum-safe data protection |
| **ITR** | Implementation & Technical Readiness | Successful deployment and operation of quantum-resistant technologies |

## Dimension 1: Cryptographic Visibility & Inventory (CVI)

### The Foundation of Quantum Readiness

**Core Purpose**: You cannot protect what you cannot see. CVI provides comprehensive visibility into all cryptographic implementations across your organization.

**Business Impact**:
- Prevents blind spots that leave systems exposed to quantum threats
- Enables risk-based prioritization of migration efforts
- Reduces costs by focusing resources on highest-risk areas
- Ensures compliance readiness for emerging regulations

**Key Capabilities**:
- Automated discovery of cryptographic assets
- Quantum vulnerability assessment and classification
- Dependency mapping for migration planning
- Continuous monitoring and inventory updates

**Without CVI**: Organizations face unknown vulnerabilities, failed migrations, wasted resources, and emergency responses when quantum threats materialize.

## Dimension 2: Strategic Governance & Risk Management (SGRM)

### Leadership for Quantum Transformation

**Core Purpose**: Quantum readiness requires sustained organizational commitment. SGRM ensures executive leadership, proper governance, and integrated risk management.

**Business Impact**:
- Secures necessary funding and resources for multi-year efforts
- Establishes clear accountability at board and executive levels
- Aligns quantum readiness with business strategy
- Extends protection to supply chain and third parties

**Key Capabilities**:
- Executive governance structures and oversight
- Quantum risk integration with enterprise risk management
- Compliance alignment with emerging standards
- Third-party and supply chain risk management

**Without SGRM**: Initiatives fail due to lack of resources, fragmented efforts, regulatory exposure, and competitive disadvantage.

## Dimension 3: Data Protection Engineering (DPE)

### Technical Protection Against Quantum Threats

**Core Purpose**: DPE implements the actual technical controls that protect sensitive data against quantum attacks across all statesâ€”at rest, in transit, and in use.

**Business Impact**:
- Protects long-term sensitive data from "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks
- Maintains customer trust through demonstrable data protection
- Ensures regulatory compliance for data protection requirements
- Preserves competitive advantages and intellectual property

**Key Capabilities**:
- Quantum-resistant encryption implementation
- Cryptographic agility for evolving standards
- Secure key management and lifecycle controls
- Performance optimization for operational efficiency

**Without DPE**: Organizations face future data breaches, intellectual property theft, regulatory penalties, and loss of customer trust.

## Dimension 4: Implementation & Technical Readiness (ITR)

### From Strategy to Operational Reality

**Core Purpose**: ITR bridges the gap between planning and execution, ensuring successful deployment, integration, and maintenance of quantum-resistant technologies.

**Business Impact**:
- Prevents costly implementation failures and rework
- Maintains business continuity during transitions
- Optimizes performance to avoid operational degradation
- Builds sustainable capabilities for long-term success

**Key Capabilities**:
- Comprehensive infrastructure assessment
- Systematic migration planning and testing
- Operational processes for quantum-safe systems
- Continuous monitoring and optimization

**Without ITR**: Organizations suffer failed deployments, system instabilities, performance problems, extended vulnerabilities, and cost overruns.

## The Power of Integration

While each dimension addresses critical aspects of quantum readiness, true organizational resilience emerges from their integration:

1. **CVI** identifies what needs protection
2. **SGRM** provides leadership and resources
3. **DPE** implements technical protections
4. **ITR** ensures successful deployment

Organizations must develop capabilities across all four dimensions. Weakness in any dimension undermines the entire quantum readiness effort.

## Getting Started

Begin your quantum readiness journey by:
1. Taking the QRAMM assessment to understand current maturity
2. Identifying priority gaps across dimensions
3. Developing a roadmap that addresses all four dimensions
4. Securing executive commitment through SGRM initiatives
5. Building foundational CVI capabilities

Remember: Quantum readiness is not a destination but a journey requiring continuous improvement across all dimensions.
