# Dimension 1: Cryptographic Visibility & Inventory (CVI)
**Understanding and cataloging cryptographic assets across the organization**

## Overview

Dimension 1 focuses on establishing comprehensive visibility into your organization's cryptographic landscape. This foundational dimension evaluates your ability to discover, inventory, assess, and map cryptographic assets across all systems, applications, and infrastructure. Without this visibility, organizations cannot effectively plan quantum-safe transitions or understand their risk exposure.

**Strategic Importance**: The transition to post-quantum cryptography requires organizations to understand exactly what cryptographic assets they have, where they're located, how vulnerable they are to quantum attacks, and how they're interconnected. This dimension provides the foundation for all quantum readiness activities.
