- **Regulatory Pressure**: Government agencies and industries are mandating post-quantum readiness assessments
- **Business Continuity**: Organizations need systematic approaches to protect data and maintain operations

### Strategic Importance
- **Security Advantage**: Early adopters will have significant security and compliance advantages
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive quantum readiness reduces future business disruption
- **Competitive Position**: Quantum-safe organizations will be preferred partners and vendors
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Emerging standards require quantum readiness planning

## Framework Architecture

QRAMM evaluates organizational quantum readiness across **4 critical dimensions**, each containing **3 specialized practices**, for a total of **12 core practices**. Each practice is assessed across **5 maturity levels** using **10 detailed questions**, providing a comprehensive 120-question evaluation framework.

### The 4 Dimensions

#### **Dimension 1: Cryptographic Visibility & Inventory (CVI)**
*Understanding and cataloging cryptographic assets across the organization*

The foundation of quantum readiness begins with comprehensive visibility into your cryptographic landscape. This dimension evaluates your organization's ability to discover, inventory, assess, and map cryptographic assets across all systems, applications, and infrastructure.

**Core Practices:**
- **1.1 Cryptographic Discovery & Inventory Management**: Systematic identification and documentation of all cryptographic implementations
- **1.2 Vulnerability Assessment & Classification**: Risk-based evaluation of quantum vulnerabilities in cryptographic assets
- **1.3 Cryptographic Dependency Mapping**: Understanding interconnections and dependencies between cryptographic components

**Key Outcomes:**
- Complete inventory of cryptographic assets with quantum vulnerability classification
- Risk-based prioritization for quantum-safe migration planning
- Clear understanding of cryptographic dependencies and potential migration bottlenecks

#### **Dimension 2: Strategic Governance & Risk Management (SGRM)**
*Leadership commitment and systematic risk management for quantum threats*

Effective quantum readiness requires strong governance structures and risk management processes. This dimension examines executive leadership, policy frameworks, risk assessment capabilities, and third-party risk management related to quantum threats.

**Core Practices:**
- **2.1 Executive Leadership & Policy Management**: Leadership direction and policy framework for quantum risk management
- **2.2 Risk Assessment & Compliance Management**: Systematic quantum risk evaluation and compliance alignment
- **2.3 Third-Party & Supply Chain Risk Management**: Managing quantum risks across vendor ecosystems

**Key Outcomes:**
- Clear leadership accountability and policy framework for quantum readiness
- Comprehensive quantum risk assessment and management capabilities
- Effective management of quantum risks across the supply chain and vendor ecosystem

#### **Dimension 3: Data Protection Engineering (DPE)**
*Technical implementation of quantum-safe data protection measures*

This dimension focuses on the technical aspects of protecting data against quantum threats. It evaluates data classification, protection requirements, storage security, encryption management, and transit security implementations.

**Core Practices:**
- **3.1 Data Classification & Protection Requirements**: Systematic data categorization and quantum-safe protection planning
- **3.2 Storage Security & Encryption Management**: Quantum-resistant protection for data at rest
- **3.3 Transit Security & Protocol Management**: Securing data in motion with quantum-safe protocols

**Key Outcomes:**
- Comprehensive data protection strategy aligned with quantum threat timelines
- Implementation of quantum-safe encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Effective management of cryptographic protocols and algorithm transitions

#### **Dimension 4: Implementation & Technical Readiness (ITR)**
*Operational capabilities for deploying and maintaining quantum-safe systems*

The final dimension examines your organization's technical and operational readiness to implement and maintain quantum-safe systems. This includes infrastructure assessment, implementation capabilities, and testing and validation processes.

**Core Practices:**
- **4.1 Infrastructure Assessment & Planning**: Evaluating and planning infrastructure for quantum-safe implementations
- **4.2 Implementation Capability Development**: Building organizational capabilities for quantum-safe deployments
- **4.3 Testing & Validation Capabilities**: Ensuring effective testing and validation of quantum-safe implementations

**Key Outcomes:**

- Comprehensive testing and validation processes for quantum-safe implementations

## Maturity Model Structure

QRAMM uses a 5-level maturity model that provides clear progression paths and benchmarks:

### Level 1: Basic
- **Characteristics**: Initial awareness and ad-hoc practices
- **Focus**: Recognition of quantum threats and basic preparatory activities
- **Typical State**: Informal processes, limited documentation, reactive approach

### Level 2: Developing  
- **Characteristics**: Structured approaches beginning to emerge
- **Focus**: Establishing formal processes and building foundational capabilities
- **Typical State**: Documented procedures, assigned responsibilities, basic tooling

### Level 3: Established
- **Characteristics**: Systematic and consistent practices
- **Focus**: Comprehensive implementation with continuous monitoring
- **Typical State**: Integrated processes, mature tooling, cross-functional coordination

### Level 4: Advanced
- **Characteristics**: Optimized processes with continuous improvement
- **Focus**: Performance optimization and proactive risk management
- **Typical State**: Automated processes, predictive analytics, strategic integration

### Level 5: Optimizing
- **Characteristics**: Industry-leading practices and innovation
- **Focus**: Continuous innovation and thought leadership
- **Typical State**: Cutting-edge practices, industry contribution, strategic advantage

## Assessment Methodology

### Two-Stream Assessment Approach

Each practice is evaluated using two complementary streams:

#### **Stream A: Foundation (60% weight)**
- **Focus**: Core capabilities essential for quantum readiness
- **Assessment**: 5 questions covering foundational requirements
- **Weighting**: Higher impact on overall practice score

#### **Stream B: Advanced (40% weight)**
- **Focus**: Advanced capabilities and optimization opportunities
- **Assessment**: 5 questions covering sophisticated implementations
- **Weighting**: Supplementary to foundational capabilities

### Scoring Methodology

#### Practice-Level Scoring
Each practice score is calculated as the average of all 10 questions within that practice:

**Practice Score = (Sum of all 10 question scores) รท 10**

#### Dimension-Level Scoring
Dimension scores use the "weakest link" principle, taking the minimum score across the three practices:

**Dimension Score = MIN(Practice 1, Practice 2, Practice 3)**

This approach ensures that organizations cannot achieve high dimension scores while having significant gaps in critical areas.

#### Overall QRAMM Score
The overall organizational score averages all four dimension scores:

**Overall QRAMM Score = (CVI + SGRM + DPE + ITR) รท 4**

### Evidence-Based Evaluation

Each question includes specific evidence indicators to guide accurate assessment:

- **Documented processes and procedures**
- **Tool outputs and automated capabilities**
- **Organizational artifacts and work products**
- **Metrics and measurement capabilities**
