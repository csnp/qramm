# QRAMM Dimensions Quick Reference

## At a Glance

| Dimension | Focus | Key Question | Primary Outcome |
|-----------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **CVI** | Visibility | What cryptographic assets do we have? | Complete cryptographic inventory |
| **SGRM** | Leadership | Who owns quantum readiness? | Executive commitment & resources |
| **DPE** | Protection | How do we protect our data? | Quantum-safe encryption deployed |
| **ITR** | Execution | Can we implement successfully? | Operational quantum security |

## One-Line Descriptions

- **CVI**: Discovers and catalogs all cryptographic assets to enable risk-based planning
- **SGRM**: Establishes leadership commitment and resources for quantum transformation
- **DPE**: Implements quantum-resistant protection for sensitive data
- **ITR**: Ensures successful deployment and operation of quantum-safe technologies

## Business Impact Summary

### CVI - Cryptographic Visibility & Inventory
**Problem Solved**: Organizations don't know what cryptographic assets they have or where quantum vulnerabilities exist  
**Business Impact**: Enables proactive planning, prevents blind spots, optimizes resource allocation  
**Without It**: Unknown vulnerabilities, failed migrations, compliance failures

### SGRM - Strategic Governance & Risk Management
**Problem Solved**: Quantum initiatives lack executive support and organizational authority  
**Business Impact**: Secures funding, breaks down silos, ensures compliance  
**Without It**: Initiative failure, budget shortfalls, fragmented efforts

### DPE - Data Protection Engineering
**Problem Solved**: Current encryption will fail against quantum computers  
**Business Impact**: Protects long-term sensitive data, maintains trust, ensures compliance  
**Without It**: Future data breaches, IP theft, regulatory penalties

### ITR - Implementation & Technical Readiness
**Problem Solved**: Organizations struggle to deploy quantum-safe technologies effectively  
**Business Impact**: Prevents implementation failures, maintains performance, builds capabilities  
**Without It**: Failed deployments, system instabilities, cost overruns

## Integration Points

```
CVI → SGRM: Inventory data informs governance decisions
SGRM → DPE: Leadership enables protection implementation
DPE → ITR: Protection requirements drive technical deployment
ITR → CVI: Implementation reveals new cryptographic assets

All dimensions create continuous feedback loops for improvement
```

## Maturity Progression

Each dimension progresses through five maturity levels:

1. **Basic**: Ad-hoc, reactive, minimal capabilities
2. **Developing**: Initial structure, some planning, basic processes
3. **Established**: Systematic approach, comprehensive coverage
4. **Advanced**: Optimized processes, continuous improvement
5. **Optimizing**: Industry leadership, innovation, knowledge sharing

## Getting Started Priorities

1. **Quick Win**: Start with CVI to understand your exposure
2. **Foundation**: Establish SGRM to secure resources
3. **Protection**: Implement DPE for critical data
4. **Excellence**: Achieve ITR for sustainable operations

Remember: Success requires progress across all four dimensions!
