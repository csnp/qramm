# QRAMM Scoring Methodology
**Comprehensive Evaluation and Interpretation Framework**

## Overview

The QRAMM scoring methodology provides a systematic approach to evaluating organizational quantum readiness across all four dimensions. This document outlines the scoring calculations, interpretation guidelines, and analysis frameworks that enable organizations to understand their current capabilities and prioritize improvement efforts.

## Scoring Structure

### Assessment Question Scoring

Each assessment question uses a **4-point scale** corresponding to the response options:

- **Score 1**: Lowest capability level (typically "No process exists" or equivalent)
- **Score 2**: Basic capability level (typically informal or limited processes)
- **Score 3**: Intermediate capability level (typically structured or systematic approaches)
- **Score 4**: Highest capability level (typically advanced or comprehensive implementations)

### Practice-Level Scoring

Each practice contains **10 questions** (5 in Stream A: Foundation, 5 in Stream B: Advanced).

**Practice Score Calculation:**
```
Practice Score = (Sum of all 10 question scores) รท 10
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Stream A Questions (1-5): Scores of 3, 2, 3, 4, 2 = Total 14
- Stream B Questions (6-10): Scores of 2, 3, 2, 3, 1 = Total 11
- Practice Score = (14 + 11) รท 10 = 2.5

### Dimension-Level Scoring

Each dimension contains **3 practices**. Dimension scoring uses the **"weakest link" principle** to ensure balanced capability development.

**Dimension Score Calculation:**
```
Dimension Score = MIN(Practice 1 Score, Practice 2 Score, Practice 3 Score)
```

**Rationale for Minimum Scoring:**
- Prevents organizations from achieving high dimension scores while having significant gaps
- Encourages balanced development across all practices within a dimension
- Reflects the interconnected nature of quantum readiness capabilities
- Aligns with risk management principles where the weakest area determines overall vulnerability

**Example Calculation:**
- Practice 1.1 Score: 3.2
- Practice 1.2 Score: 2.8
- Practice 1.3 Score: 3.5
- Dimension 1 Score = MIN(3.2, 2.8, 3.5) = 2.8

### Overall QRAMM Score

The overall organizational score represents the average across all four dimensions.

**Overall QRAMM Score Calculation:**
```
Overall Score = (Dimension 1 + Dimension 2 + Dimension 3 + Dimension 4) รท 4
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Dimension 1 (CVI): 2.8
- Dimension 2 (SGRM): 3.1
- Dimension 3 (DPE): 2.5
- Dimension 4 (ITR): 2.9
- Overall QRAMM Score = (2.8 + 3.1 + 2.5 + 2.9) รท 4 = 2.8
