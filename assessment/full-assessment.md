## Scoring Methodology

The QRAMM assessment uses a 5-point scale where:
- Each question is scored from 1-5 based on the selected maturity level
- Practice scores are calculated as the average of all questions within that practice
- Dimension scores are calculated as the average of all practices within that dimension
- Overall QRAMM score is calculated as the average of all four dimension scores
