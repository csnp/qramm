# Compliance Tab Vision - Summary for Developer

## Core Purpose
Transform the compliance mapping data from Document 4 (`4_QRAMM_Compliance_Mapping_Details.md`) into an interactive Excel interface that shows users how their QRAMM assessment scores translate to compliance with 8 federal/industry frameworks.

## What We're Building (Using Existing Specs)

### 1. Data Source
- **Already Provided**: Complete mapping table in Document 4
- 120 QRAMM questions mapped to 8 frameworks
- Weights from 0.0 to 1.0 for each mapping
- All framework controls clearly identified

### 2. The 8 Frameworks (As Specified)
1. NIST CSF 2.0 (Cybersecurity Framework)
2. NIST PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards)
3. CMMC 2.0 (Cybersecurity Maturity Model)
4. FISMA (Federal Information Security Management)
5. FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management)
6. ISO 27001/27002:2022
7. SOC2 (Trust Services Criteria)
8. CIS v8 (Critical Security Controls)

### 3. Key Functionality

**What Users Need to See:**
1. **Overall Compliance Score** - Single percentage for selected framework
2. **Gap Analysis** - Which controls are not adequately covered
3. **Improvement Roadmap** - Which QRAMM practices to improve for biggest compliance impact
4. **Coverage Visualization** - Progress bars or charts showing strength/weakness areas

**How It Works:**
```
User's QRAMM Score × Mapping Weight = Control Coverage
Sum of all Control Coverages / Total Possible = Compliance %
```

### 4. User Workflow
1. Complete QRAMM assessment (120 questions)
2. Go to Compliance tab
3. Select a framework from dropdown
4. View compliance score and gaps
5. See prioritized improvements
6. Export compliance report

## Implementation Using Document 4

### The Mapping Structure (Already Defined)
```
| Question | NIST CSF | NIST PQC | CMMC | FISMA | FedRAMP | ISO | SOC2 | CIS |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|--------|---------|-----|------|-----|
| Q1       | ID.AM-1 (1.0) | - | AC.L1-3.1.1 (0.8) | SI-12 (0.8) | CM-8 (1.0) | A.8.1.1 (1.0) | CC6.1 (0.8) | 1.1 (1.0) |
```

### Key Calculations
1. **Control Coverage** = Question Score × Mapping Weight
2. **Framework Compliance** = Average of all mapped control coverages
3. **Gap Priority** = Controls with coverage < 70% and weight ≥ 0.8

## Visual Design Principles

### Excel-Native Features Only
- Data validation dropdowns for framework selection
- Conditional formatting for red/yellow/green indicators
- REPT formulas for progress bars
- Structured tables for sorting/filtering
- Standard Excel charts (if needed)

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Top Level**: Overall compliance percentage (big and bold)
2. **Second Level**: Category breakdowns (Identify, Protect, etc.)
3. **Detail Level**: Individual control mappings with gaps highlighted

### Color Coding (Using Excel's Standard Conditional Formatting)
- **Green**: ≥ 80% coverage
- **Yellow**: 60-79% coverage  
- **Red**: < 60% coverage
- **Gray**: Not applicable (weight = 0)

## What Makes This Valuable

### For End Users
1. **Instant Understanding**: "We're 73% compliant with NIST CSF"
2. **Clear Priorities**: "Fix these 5 things to reach 85% compliance"
3. **Business Case**: "Improving quantum readiness directly improves compliance"
4. **Audit Ready**: Export shows mapping rationale and evidence

### For Organizations
- Links quantum readiness (new concept) to established compliance (familiar requirement)
- Justifies quantum preparation investment through compliance benefits
- Provides roadmap for systematic improvement
- Creates audit trail for regulatory requirements

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Must Have Features
1. Framework selector (dropdown)
2. Overall score calculation and display
3. Gap identification (controls < 70% coverage)
4. Basic visual indicators (colors, progress bars)
5. Export capability (even if just print-friendly formatting)

### Nice to Have Features
1. Side-by-side framework comparison
2. Trend tracking over time
3. What-if analysis ("If we improve X, compliance increases by Y%")
4. Drill-down to specific question level

### Excel Best Practices
- Put all mapping data in hidden "Data" sheet
- Use named ranges for clarity
- Keep calculations in separate area from display
- Test with Excel 2016 for compatibility
- Optimize formulas for performance with large dataset

## Summary
The Compliance tab takes the detailed mapping from Document 4 and makes it actionable. Users should immediately see where they stand, what's missing, and what to do next. Everything needed is already defined in the specs - this is about presentation and user experience.
