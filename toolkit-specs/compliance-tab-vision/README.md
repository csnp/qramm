# Compliance Tab Vision & Requirements

This folder contains the complete vision and specifications for the QRAMM Toolkit Compliance Tab.

## Files in this folder:
1. **compliance-tab-mockup.html** - Visual mockup showing the desired UI/UX
2. **compliance-tab-detailed-requirements.md** - Detailed functional requirements
3. **compliance-tab-developer-guide.md** - Implementation guide for Excel

## Quick Summary for Developer

The Compliance tab needs to:
1. Map QRAMM assessment scores to 8 compliance frameworks
2. Show compliance gaps and coverage percentages
3. Allow users to adjust mapping weights
4. Generate actionable insights for improvement
5. Export compliance reports

The core innovation is making compliance mapping dynamic and actionable rather than static.

## Key Implementation Points

### Data Structure
- Use the mapping table from Document 4 (4_QRAMM_Compliance_Mapping_Details.md)
- Each QRAMM question maps to multiple framework controls with weights (0.0-1.0)
- Store mappings in hidden Data tab for lookup

### User Interface
- Start with framework selection (cards/buttons)
- Show overall compliance score prominently
- Use color coding: Green (>80%), Yellow (60-80%), Red (<60%)
- Progressive disclosure - overview first, then details

### Calculations
```excel
Compliance Score = SUMPRODUCT(Question_Scores, Mapping_Weights) / SUM(Mapping_Weights)
```

### Features Priority
1. **Must Have**: Framework selection, score calculation, gap identification
2. **Should Have**: Weight adjustment, visual charts, drill-down details
3. **Nice to Have**: Multi-framework comparison, what-if analysis

## Design Philosophy
Make compliance feel strategic, not bureaucratic. Users should immediately see:
- Where they stand (scores)
- What's missing (gaps)
- What to do next (recommendations)

The mockup shows the ideal experience - implement as much as feasible in Excel.
