## Business Impact Statements

| Dimension | Low Score Impact | High Score Benefit |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| CVI | Blind to quantum threats, unable to prioritize protection efforts, risk of sudden cryptographic failure | Complete visibility enables proactive protection, efficient resource allocation, and confident decision-making |
| SGRM | Uncoordinated efforts waste resources, compliance failures, lack of accountability for quantum readiness | Strong governance ensures adequate investment, clear accountability, and sustainable quantum security program |
| DPE | Sensitive data exposed to quantum attacks, regulatory non-compliance, potential data breaches | Robust protection maintains confidentiality, ensures compliance, and protects organizational reputation |
| ITR | Technical debt prevents implementation, integration failures, operational disruptions | Modern infrastructure enables smooth transitions, maintains availability, and supports business growth |

## Conditional Display Logic

### Executive Summary Messages
```
IF overall_score < 1.5 AND high_risk_industry:
  "CRITICAL: Your organization faces severe quantum risk exposure requiring immediate executive action"
  
IF overall_score < 2.0 AND compliance_required:
  "WARNING: Current quantum readiness threatens regulatory compliance - urgent improvements needed"
  
IF overall_score < 2.5:
  "CONCERN: Significant gaps in quantum readiness require systematic improvement program"
  
IF overall_score < 3.0:
  "PROGRESS: Foundation in place but continued investment needed for quantum resilience"
  
IF overall_score >= 3.0:
  "STRONG: Organization demonstrates quantum readiness - maintain momentum and industry leadership"
```

### Risk-Adjusted Timeline Recommendations
```
Standard Risk (multiplier < 1.1):
- Year 1: CVI + SGRM foundations
- Year 2: DPE implementation
- Year 3: ITR optimization

Medium Risk (multiplier 1.1-1.3):
- Q1-Q2: CVI + SGRM urgent
- Q3-Q4: DPE deployment
- Year 2: ITR completion

High Risk (multiplier > 1.3):
- Month 1: Executive action + CVI
- Month 2-3: SGRM + critical DPE
- Month 4-6: Full implementation
