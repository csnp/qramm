# Our Mission
Our mission is to provide organizations with an effective and measurable way to evaluate and enhance their quantum resilience and cryptographic readiness for the post-quantum era. Developed under the CyberSecurity NonProfit (CSNP), QRAMM aims to enable organizations to confidently assess, plan, and implement quantum-safe security measures through a comprehensive self-assessment model that drives continuous improvement.

## Overview
The Quantum Readiness Assurance Maturity Model (QRAMM) is a framework designed to help organizations measure and improve their quantum readiness and cryptographic security capabilities. As quantum computing advances threaten current encryption standards, this toolkit provides a structured approach to assess your organization's current maturity level and identify critical areas requiring quantum-safe transformation.

## Framework Structure
QRAMM evaluates four critical dimensions:

1. **Cryptographic Visibility & Inventory (CVI)**
2. **Strategic Governance & Risk Management (SGRM)**
3. **Data Protection Engineering (DPE)**
4. **Implementation & Technical Readiness (ITR)**

Each dimension contains 3 specialized practices, totaling 12 core practices. Each practice is assessed through two streams:

- **Stream A (Foundation)**: Core capabilities essential for quantum readiness (60% weight)
- **Stream B (Advanced)**: Advanced capabilities and optimization opportunities (40% weight)

## Scoring System
The QRAMM toolkit uses a comprehensive scoring system that calculates both raw and weighted scores:

### Raw Scores
- **1.0-1.5**: Basic - Initial awareness and ad-hoc practices
- **1.6-2.5**: Developing - Structured approaches beginning to emerge
- **2.6-3.5**: Established - Systematic and consistent practices
- **3.6-3.9**: Advanced - Optimized processes with continuous improvement
- **4.0**: Optimizing - Perfect score demonstrating excellence and industry leadership

### Weighted Scores
Your organization's unique context affects your target quantum readiness level. The Organization Profile Tab captures this context through a profile multiplier (0.8-1.5x) that adjusts raw scores based on:

- **Industry Requirements**: The inherent security needs and quantum threat exposure of your industry sector
- **Regulatory Obligations**: Current and emerging quantum security compliance requirements
- **Organizational Scale**: The size, complexity, and geographic distribution of your operations
- **Data Sensitivity**: The criticality and longevity of data requiring protection
- **Technology Complexity**: The sophistication of your IT infrastructure and cryptographic implementations

For example, a financial institution handling long-term sensitive data would have a higher profile multiplier than a retail business with primarily transactional data, reflecting the greater urgency and rigor required for quantum-safe transformation.

**Note on Weighted Scores**: While raw scores cap at 4.0 (Level 5: Optimizing), weighted scores can exceed 4.0 for high-risk organizations. For example, a healthcare organization with a multiplier of 1.33 and strong dimension scores could see weighted scores like 4.07, 4.54, or even 5.32. An organization with a perfect raw score (4.0) and maximum risk multiplier (1.5) would achieve a weighted score of 6.0, demonstrating exceptional quantum readiness that exceeds standard requirements. This reflects that high-risk organizations must achieve higher standards to adequately address their elevated quantum threat exposure.

This ensures that maturity targets and recommendations align with your organization's specific quantum risk profile and circumstances.

Note - Optional questions are included for comprehensive assessment and 'N/A' responses will not affect your overall score.

## Scorecard Tab Overview
The Scorecard tab provides a comprehensive view of your quantum readiness assessment results:

### Overall Results
- **Overall QRAMM Score**: Combined score across all four dimensions
- **Overall Maturity Level**: Your current quantum readiness maturity level
- **Assessment Completion Status**: Progress tracking across all 120 questions
- **Quantum Risk Timeline**: Estimated timeline for quantum threat relevance to your organization

### Dimension Scoring Summary
For each dimension:

- **Raw Score**: Direct calculation from assessment responses (average of practice scores)
- **Weighted Score**: Profile multiplier-adjusted calculation based on organizational context
- **Maturity Level**: Current dimension maturity level (Basic/Developing/Established/Advanced/Optimizing)
- **Industry Benchmark**: Comparison against similar organizations in your industry
- **Percentage**: Progress toward maximum possible score

### Visual Analytics
The Scorecard provides comprehensive visual insights including:

- **Dimension Scoring Chart**: Bar chart comparing raw scores across all four dimensions
- **Maturity Distribution**: Donut chart showing the percentage of practices at each maturity level
- **Spider/Radar Chart**: Visual comparison of your weighted scores against industry benchmarks

### Highlights and Recommendations
- **Top Strengths**: Automatically identifies your highest-scoring practices with specific achievements
- **Areas for Improvement**: Pinpoints lowest-scoring practices requiring immediate attention
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Context-specific guidance based on your scores and organizational profile
- **Practice-Level Insights**: Detailed breakdown showing individual practice scores and maturity levels

## Assessment Approach
QRAMM provides two assessment entry points:

### Quick Assessment (12 Questions)
- **Time Investment**: 5-10 minutes
- **Purpose**: Initial quantum readiness baseline
- **Coverage**: 3 key questions per dimension
- **Output**: Executive summary with immediate priorities

### Comprehensive Assessment (120 Questions)
- **Time Investment**: 2-4 hours with stakeholder input
- **Purpose**: Complete quantum readiness evaluation
- **Coverage**: 10 detailed questions per practice (30 per dimension)
- **Output**: Detailed scorecards, gap analysis, compliance mapping, and implementation roadmap

## Compliance Mapping
QRAMM maps to 8 major frameworks and standards:

1. **NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards**: Alignment with NIST's quantum-safe algorithms
